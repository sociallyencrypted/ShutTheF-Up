# ShutTheF-Up
Final course project for DES206: Prototyping Interactive Systems

## Details
The concept is to show a mocumentary of censorship in the form of "Democratised Inverted Censorship", where people get to vote on a live speech, and if the votes cross 50%, the speech is censored. We accomplished this by making a webapp in Flask for voting and by writing a python program using pyAudio to control the mic and speaker, and set triggers using a REST API.

## Prerequisites
```bash
pip install flask
pip install pyaudio
```

## Run
```bash
python3 main2.py
```
